# DeepLearning

Hi, this is my code files related to deep learning study in SZU.

I mostly use MNIST dataset and Fashion-MNIST dataset to setup, train, and evaluate my model.

These notebooks may offer help for freshmen in deep learning, for all code are logically written and you can know the model thing with running each code chunk.

I also update all the data you need to train.

Feel free to git and plz let me know the bugs when using it and send issues.


! Some code are written by my lecturer, many thanks.
